Pixel Scaler - A Pixel Art Upscaling Tool
=========================================

Overview
--------
Pixel Scaler is a tool that upscales pixel art with high quality.  
It uses the xBR algorithm to convert pixel art into a smooth, illustration-like style.

Supported formats:
- gif / jpeg / png

How to Use
----------
1. Launch Pixel Scaler.
2. Select or drag & drop the image you want to upscale.
3. Enter the desired scale percentage (100%–10000%).
4. Set the "Pixel Size":
   - For original pixel art: enter `1`
   - For already upscaled images: enter the scale factor (e.g., 2x → 2)
5. Click the "Convert" button.
6. The upscaled image will appear.
7. Click "Output" or "Output All" to save it.

Tips
----
- Best results are achieved by using original-size pixel art.
- Low-resolution illustrations (non-pixel art) will not upscale cleanly.
- Setting the scale to 100% applies anti-aliasing to the image.
- If the "Pixel Size" does not match the actual size in the image, conversion may fail.

License and Copyright
---------------------
You may use the converted images freely for personal or commercial purposes within reasonable bounds.
